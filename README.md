An example on how to integrate the base MonCash Rest API in your Laravel project without any 3rd party package.

This example focuses on the

## Installation

1) Clone the package

```shell
gh repo clone Fruitsbytes/Laravel-Moncash-Example
```

2) Install the packages
```shell
php composer install
```
or using [Laravel Sail + Docker](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/sail#installing-composer-dependencies-for-existing-projects)

```shell
docker run --rm \
    -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v $(pwd):/var/www/html \
    -w /var/www/html \
    laravelsail/php81-composer:latest \
    composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
```



Note: Some extensions are required for specific strategies but you can switch strategies in the `config/moncash.php
`file.

3) Migrate the database (Make sur the configurations OK)
```shell
php artisan migrate
```
or if you are using Docker

```shell
sail artisan migrate
```


4) Add the credentials to the `.env` file or diretcly in the `./config/moncash.php` _(âš  unsafe)_ file.

By default the demo site will be available in http://localhost/

## Usage

Add products to the cart from the product list. In the cart, use MonCash as a payment method. You can check the status
of a transaction

You will need a valid test phone number or you will not be able to go through with the.

You can use Ngrok to tunnel server responses

### Create a Business

In the

#### Return Url

MonCash server will signal your server directly to that URL
> example : http://localhost/api/notify

In production a good pratice would be that you put MonCash IP/DomainName in the Allowlist (Acceptlist or Whitelist) of the server for that
specific endpoint. 

To illustrate that this is not a connection initiated by you to the MonCash server we put it in the `/api` routes. It can be a different server that is specifically tailored to fulfill the transaction, differebt than the one used to display the products. 


On a local server, you can use [Ngrok](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup) to tunnel or `sail share` if you are using [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/sail#sharing-your-site)

#### Alert Url

After the transaction is finished, the transactionId is appended to the URL so you can check the value
> result : http://localhost/success?transactionId=2185608546

NOTE: If you share Your local server via a proxie or use an online instance, make sure to configure the Business in the MonCash admin portal accordingly

## Pick a Strategy
We proposed several service providers to handle the business logic.

###   Authentication
If we can cache yje token andd re-use it until it expires this will reduce the nuber of new token requests we make to the API.
- Redis (recommended)
- ðŸš§  MySQL
- HTTP (default / fallback)

### Payment log
Store the Payment for later use, example: Approve the delivery pf the products after the payment is verified as successful, or use this information for accounting reports.
- Redis (fast)
- MySQL (default/fallback)
- ðŸš§ File (Slow, needs permission)

### OrderID
Get a uniq orderID that we can use to reference the transaction later, especially if we don' t have a transactionID yet to link to the cirrent order.  
- UUID (low risk of collision)
- ðŸš§ MySQL (No collision but slow. The toll increases in distributed infrastructure )
- Random Uniq ID (Not too reliable, expecially with distributed infrastructure )
