Here you will find alist of examples on how to integrate the base MonCash Rest API in your Laravel project without any SDK.

Available examples for an __online__ business:
- [Advanced](./laravel-moncash-example), Using Facades + Service Providers +  Strategies + i18n + Cart + Checkout
- [Basic](./laravel-moncash-basic-example), One page + Fixed prices 

Available examples for onsite experience :
- ðŸš§ [Advanced](./laravel-moncash-onsite-example), CashIn + POS / Cashier dashboard with QR code Scanner
- ðŸš§ [Basic](./laravel-moncash-onsite-basic-example), CashOut 

## How to
You can find a guide explaining how we consume the MonCash API here: [How To](./How%20To/README.md).

You can use it to make your own implementation from scratch. 

## Installation

1) Clone the repository

```shell
gh repo clone Fruitsbytes/Laravel-Moncash-Example
```

2) Navigate to the example you want to run:
```shell
cd ./laravel-moncash-example
```

3) Install the packages
```shell
php composer install
```
or using [Laravel Sail + Docker](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/sail#installing-composer-dependencies-for-existing-projects)

```shell
docker run --rm \
    -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v $(pwd):/var/www/html \
    -w /var/www/html \
    laravelsail/php81-composer:latest \
    composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
```



Note: Some extensions are required for specific strategies but you can switch strategies in the `config/moncash.php
`file.

4) Migrate the database (make sure the configurations is OK)
```shell
php artisan migrate
```
or if you are using Docker

```shell
sail artisan migrate
```


4) Add the credentials to the `.env` file or diretcly in the `./config/moncash.php` _(âš  unsafe)_ file.

By default the demo site will be available in http://localhost/

## Usage

Add products to the cart from the product list. In the cart, use MonCash as a payment method. You can check the status
of a transaction

You will need a valid test phone number or you will not be able to go through with the.

You can use Ngrok to tunnel server responses

### Setup a Business

In the MonCadh portal, create a new __online__ business and get the credentals. You will also need to stup the Return URL + Alert URL

#### Return Url

MonCash server will signal your server directly to that URL
> example : http://localhost/api/notify

In production, a good pratice would be that you put MonCash IP/DomainName in the Allowlist (Acceptlist or Whitelist) of the server for that
specific endpoint. 

To illustrate that this is not a connection initiated by you to the MonCash server, we put it in the `/api` routes. 

In a real world application, It can be a different server that is specifically tailored to fulfill the transaction, working in sync with the one used to display the products. 


On a local server, you can use [Ngrok](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup) to tunnel or `sail share` if you are using [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/sail#sharing-your-site)

#### Alert Url

After the transaction is finished, the transactionId is appended to the URL so you can check the value
> result : http://localhost/success?transactionId=2185608546

NOTE: If you share Your local server via a proxie or use an online instance, make sure to configure the Business in the MonCash admin portal accordingly

## General concept
We proposed several service providers to handle the business logic.

###   Authentication + Cache
If we can cache the token and re-use it until it expires this will reduce the number of new token requests we make to the API. 

Configure the cache in the `config/cache.php`
- Redis (default)
- MySQL
- File
- MemCache
- No Cache , pure HTTP (fallback)
- ...


### Payment log
Store the Payment for later use, example: Approve the delivery of the products after the payment is verified as successful, or use this information for accounting reports.

Configure the Database connection for the Payment Model.
- Redis (fast)
- MySQL (default)
- File (Slow, needs permission)

### OrderID (Reference Id)
Get a uniq orderID that we can use to reference the transaction later, especially if we don' t have a transactionID yet to link to the cirrent order.  
- UUID (low risk of collision)
- ðŸš§ MySQL (No collision but slow. The toll increases in distributed infrastructure )
- Random Uniq ID (Not too reliable, expecially with distributed infrastructure )
