## About this example

In this exalpe we simulate an e-commerce website using Laravel and MonCash as a payment system.

Copy `.env.example` into `.env` and fill the missing environment variables values ( APP_KEY, MONCASH, PUSHER...). 

You should be all set to start :
```shell
sail up
```

```shell
composer install
```

In opposition to the [Basic example](../laravel-moncash-basic-example), we use :

- [Facades](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/facades)
- [Service Providers](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/providers)
- [Containers](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/container)
- [Cache](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/cache)
- [Queue/Job](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/queues)
- [Echo](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/broadcasting#client-side-installation)
- Data Persistance with MySQL
- ðŸš§ Swap environment configuration in the settings
- Strategies design patterns
- ðŸš§ i18n Internationalisation
    - English
    - French
    - Kreyol
- Cart + Checkout simulation
- ðŸš§ Confirmation Email
- ðŸš§ Confirmation SMS
- ðŸš§ Cron job to periodically check for missed signal from MonCash

#### âš  IMPORTANT:

In this example we use queues to safely  process payment transactions and optimize the server performance.

You will need to select a valid queue connection (default is redis)
and [run the queue worker](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/queues#running-the-queue-worker):

```shell
php artisan queue:work
```

or

```shell
sail php artisan queue:work
```

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and
creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in
many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache)
  storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
